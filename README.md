## 👋 About This Repository

This repository documents my hands-on cybersecurity lab work completed as part of the AltSchool Africa Security Operations Engineering program. Each week covers a core offensive/defensive security concept, executed in a controlled, authorized environment.

The labs demonstrate practical skills in reconnaissance, scanning, exploitation, and reporting — the same workflow used in real-world penetration testing engagements.

## 🔍 Week 1 Highlights — Recon & Footprinting

> **Target:** altschoolafrica.com (authorized lab domain)  
> **Date:** 12 December 2025

### What I did
- Performed **passive OSINT** to enumerate subdomains, DNS records, email infrastructure, and hosting providers without touching the target directly
- Ran **active Nmap scans** to identify open ports and services
- Identified **staging environments** publicly exposed on the internet
- Built a **Data Flow Diagram** mapping the full attack surface
- Prioritized the **top 5 targets** by risk level

### Key Findings
- 10+ subdomains discovered including exposed staging servers (`students-staging`, `connect-stage`)
- Domain protected by **Cloudflare** — origin IP successfully hidden
- **Google Workspace** confirmed as email provider via MX records
- Ports **80, 443, 8080, 8443** open — all routed through Cloudflare reverse proxy
- No direct OS fingerprinting possible due to Cloudflare obfuscation
